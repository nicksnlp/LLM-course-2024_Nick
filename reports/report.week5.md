## Weeks 5 and 6

I have had problems in running the *Streamlit UI* on my local machine, I have installed Docker and other dependencies, but still had problems with it.

But the notebook setup for RAG worked.

Unfortunately, I did not have time to finish up those exercises to the desired level, which is something I wish to be able to do in the future...
