## Week 2

Although it felt just as a beginning, the week and exercises were very useful indeed to learn how to start and set things up, and I have learned a lot about practical aspects of dealing with LLMs.

I have created a Hugging Face account, learned how to use secrets and implement them within my code, both in Colab and in the python code through the system configuration files.

I have also activated API keys for Gemini and OpenAi, and learned how to use them.

I have created a python environment and tested the prompting chatbot, with a configuration file, and the notebook (it was slightly easier there). I made the LLM to sing songs about *pirates* and include words in latin (or another specified language) into it.

Also, I have already managed to put those things into practice for some other work. I found configuration to be very useful, and the fact that you can loop through the prompts, and in that way implement ***zero-shot*** or ***few-shot*** prompting with variable parameters.
